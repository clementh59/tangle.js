# Examples

This folder contains several examples that illustrate the usage of the Anchors and LD Proofs libraries.
Examples run both on Node.js and on a Web Browser. 

To run examples first install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

If you want to run the examples on a Web Browser you need to Webpack them:

```sh
npm run build-web
npm run test-web
```
